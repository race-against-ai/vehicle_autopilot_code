<br>
- Adapter -> Modification of the old vehicle using the 3D printer <br>
<br>
- camera_rear: <br>
- hough          -> hough algorithm (#outdated) <br>
- machine-learn  -> machine learning algorithm (#outdated) <br>
- record-video   -> file to record a video (#finished) <br>
- samples        -> samples of the car <br>
<br>
- camera_front: <br>
- sliding-windows -> sliding windows (#outdated) <br>
- inside-out      -> efficent technique (#in development) <br>
<br>
- camera_record: <br>
- video recording -> file to record a video (#finished) <br>
<br>
- presentation: <br>
- Explanation of the Hough algorithm: "Explanation of the Hough algorithm" <br>
- Explanation of sliding windows: "Explanation of sliding windows" <br>

The project utilizes the [PiRacer-Py](https://github.com/twyleg/piracer_py) library.
